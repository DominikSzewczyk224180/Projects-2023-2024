# Sprint 1 - Week 1 - Scoping - Kian
## Sprint review
### Progress
* Pre-processing is nearly finished.
* Labelled extra images.
* Mostly reviewed requirements and scoped project.
* 3/5 working days because of national holidays.

### To do
* Configure DevOps a bit more.
* Work on package plan for a higher level overview.
* Work on production ready code.

### Feedback
* Package plan can be a one-pager containing: functional requirements, structure and scripts, pipeline overview, potential input/outpus. The SCRUM-master should be able to create a clear sprint-planning wiht the team based off of the package plan.
* We are going to need to know the confidence of the model, we could implement a heatmap with probability per pixel.
* Print statements are the bare minimum for logging, check out logging library.
* Sphinx can convert the docstrings to automatically generate documentation for the website.
* Logging, type hinting, docstrings, PEP8, logging, unit-testing should be implemented for each function, these are added to the review board and need to be done before it can be dragged to completion.

### Hierarchy
* Epic: feature
* Issue: script
* Task: function

## Thursday
Absencies: None

### Stand-up
1. Announcements

2. Self-study / evidence review
> Will look at self study today
3. Review current backlog
> All seems alright for now, this will most likely change next weeks
4. Plan for today
> Work on pre-processing
5. Formulate action points
> See action points

### Action points
1. All - work on pre-processing in jupyter notebook so we can clearly view outputs
2. Kian - ask for feedback on backlog and configure DevOps a bit more
3. All - come up with team names/package names
4. All - review self-study materials and evidence

### Feedback

### Discussion notes
Work method: notebooks folder in project as working folder, so we can see the ouputs of code blocks and naming conventing intitials_process.ipynb = DS_pre-process.ipynb

## Wednesday
Absencies: None
### Stand-up
1. Announcements
> Informed Dean about current workflow
2. Self-study / evidence review
> Everybody worked on self-study materials
3. Progress
> * Set some management things in place
> * Understand team's capabilities and interests
> * Review block B
5. Today's plan
> * Review block B
> * Create folder structure
> * Make product backlog / package plan
> * Plan sprint
> * Check in with Dean end of the day
6. Feedback
> * Put together functional requirements, look at code and then start making the package plan and see who already satisfied which functionalities
> * Look through the datalab planning to help structure the repository
Three levels epics, issues, tasks, epics are major features, issues define functionalities, which are divided into tasks (like low level functions). The tasks should be super specific and assigned to a person. What is the input output, when is complete. Estimate will fill in th eeffort automatically.
7. Formulate action points
> See action points

### Action points
1. Dominik - Work on folder structure
2. Kian - upload files and configure DevOps environment
3. All - plan sprint and work on backlog, review preivous block


### Feedback at the end of the day
Focus on completing features, instead of making half progress on all features. Think about the outputs we need in other phases and features. Each sprint you will have about 2-3 epics. Product backlog should be focused on the product features. There is data available, we can keep an eye that.

### Discussion notes
* We need to figure out how to deal with breaking off roots and overlapping plants, or small roots
* Look into various architectures
* Implement a feedback loop to improve model performance
* Potentially use weight map?
* Use density in area to determine nois/background/root
* Implement skeleton IDs

### Feedback

### Discussion notes
Recently, in the team started the discussion of switching to Pytorch, because all of us faced issues with tensorflow (expect Kian, who is a macbook user). However, this might mean that we have to rewrite a lot of code, so we decided to keep it as a plan B

## Questions to the product owner


# Sprint 3 - Week 3 - Focus: Finalizing Tasks - Dominik
## Sprint review
### Progress
* The pipelines are almost finished
* Bigger part of the package is done.

### To do
* Finish completely the pipeline
* Continue working on the uncompleted tasks from the second split
* Start working on the cloud

### Feedback
* The Devops dashboard should be more active - the task should be moved to their respective column whether they are in progress or not.
* The dashboard should be more organized with better described tasks, so they can be easily picked without waiting for someone to explain them.
* The pipelines are almost done, which is usefull with contiunuing doing the tasks for the next sprint
* Work on the tasks from the previous sprint until Wednesday the first week and after that start working on the the tasks for this one.

# Sprint 3 Review - Scrum Master - Dominik

## Progress
During this sprint, the team made significant advancements. The inference pipeline and training pipeline were completed. Key tasks such as configuring padding, patchifying, unpatchifying, reshaping, and application design were successfully finished. Cloud Data Management was implemented, and the multiclass model was integrated into the inference pipeline. We visualized heatmaps with model predictions, predicted plant organs, and handled training cost expectations. Environment and dependency management were addressed, and we developed a prediction script, evaluated the model, and trained the multiclass model. The pipeline creation in the cloud is 95% complete. We also designed and planned the cloud architecture, ensuring the API works with real-time data. All functions were written in production-ready code, with unit tests, type hinting, logging, and Sphinx documentation.

## What Went Well
- 5 out of 5 team members voted that the stand-ups were well organized and went really well.
- Successful transition to the cloud.
- Sphinx documentation was set up effectively.

## What Went Bad
- Lack of team-building exercises this sprint, which is unacceptable.
- Communication about task progress was not clear, leading to confusion about the status of some tasks.

## Action Points
1. Improve communication about daily progress. If someone encounters an error, they should inform the team before the end of the day.
2. Keep the team updated on the progress of tasks, especially new tasks. We will introduce sections where the person responsible for a task will explain its status.
3. Organize team-building exercises.
